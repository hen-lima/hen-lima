### <p align="left">Hi there ~</p> 
   
  I'm a rookie having a blast at [42Porto.](https://www.42porto.com/)<br>
  This is where I'll be uploading all projects developed throughout the course.

## Common Core Projects 

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>

  <br>The **Common Core** is the combination of all projects and exams we go through before choosing a specialty. Its content is assembled into ranks and can be tracked by our **Holy Graph**: a radial scheme displaying all available subjects.<br>

  All projects have a **Mandatory** and a **Bonus** part. The <kbd>Bonus ${\color{lightgreen}✓}$</kbd> is only accessed if the Mandatory part is flawless, and by succeeding on it we're granted extra score.
