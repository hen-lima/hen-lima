### <p align="left">Hi there ~</p> 
   
  I'm a rookie having a blast at [42Porto.](https://www.42porto.com/)<br>
  This is where I'll be uploading all projects developed throughout the course.
<br><br>

## Common Core Projects 

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  
  <br>The **Common Core** is the result of all projects and tests we progress through during our journey at 42. This educational framework is assembled into tiers and can be tracked by using the **Holy Graph**: a radial scheme starting 
  from 0 at the core and expanding outwards until rank 6.<br>
  <br>
  All projects have a Mandatory and a Bonus part. Completing the Bonus part will always grant extra score.<br>
  The tags <kbd>Bonus ✓ </kbd> and <kbd><samp>XXX / 100</samp></kbd> will respectivelly indicate which of my projects were submited with Bonus, as well as the final score.<br>
