### <p align="left">Hi there ~</p> 
   
  I'm a rookie having a blast at [42Porto.](https://www.42porto.com/)<br>
  This is where I'll be uploading all projects developed throughout the course.

## Common Core Projects 

<details>
  <summary>What is it?</summary>
   - There's sort of a radial scheme we call the **Holy Graph**. It organizes our projects into tiers, starting from 0 at the innermost part and extending to the outermost level 6.
  As we progress from the center-outwards, the complexity of each project also exponentially increases.<br>
  It also takes passing a test to move from one rank to another. We receive tiny ducks once we do so, which is pretty cool. 
  All those projects and tests combined compound The **Common Core**. 
  Way more important than all that, we are grant tiny rubber ducks for each test we successfuly pass.
