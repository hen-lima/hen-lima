### <p align="left">Hi there ~</p> 
   
  I'm a rookie having a blast at [42Porto.](https://www.42porto.com/)<br>
  This is where I'll be uploading all projects developed throughout the course.
<br><br>

## Common Core Projects 

<details>
  <summary>Description</summary>
  <h5>The **Common Core** is the combination of all projects and tests we progress through before chosing a specialty. Its content is assembled into tiers and can be tracked by using the **Holy Graph**: a radial scheme starting 
  from 0 at the innermost part and expanding outwards until rank 6.<br><br>
  All projects have a **Mandatory** and a **Bonus** part. The Bonus is only accessed if the Mandatory part is flawless, and succeding on it will always grant you extra points.
  The tags <kbd>Bonus ✓ </kbd> and <kbd><samp>*** / 100</samp></kbd> will respectivelly indicate which of my projects were submitted with Bonus, as well as the final score.
