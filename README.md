### <p align="left">Hi there ~</p> 
   
  I'm a rookie having a blast at [42Porto.](https://www.42porto.com/)<br>
  This is where I'll be uploading all projects developed throughout the course.
<br><br>

## Common Core Projects 

  There's sort of a radial scheme that we call the **Holy Graph**. It displays our projects into tiers, starting from 0 which is the inner part, until the outmost level 6.<br>
  As we advance from the center of the graph outwards, the difficulty also exponentially increases.<br>
  To successfully conclude all projects and each rank's test, is to successfully complete the **Common Core**.
